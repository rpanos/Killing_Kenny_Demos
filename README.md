  A series of Demos showing differences in JavaScript frameworks

In NO way do these small examples give a complete and fair take on ALL the pros and cons of these JS frameworks, but I do believe these demos make some powerful aurguments.  Beginners might also learn a few things by comparing them.

Pls stay tuned for my ramblings on the details impied aurguments.  Currently the comments hint at SOME of them.
